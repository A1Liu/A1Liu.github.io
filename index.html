    About Me
  </h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Albert, and this is my website! I'm a Junior at NYU majoring in Math
    and Computer Science. This website is mainly for my own personal use, but
    feel free to use the stuff on here or copy the source code into your own
    project! (Please read and follow the license though.)

  <h2>
    What I'm Doing Now
  </h2>
  <p>
    Right now I'm working on 3 things: <a href="https://github.com/A1Liu/schedge">Schedge</a>,
    a course scheduling API, an app prototype for a startup, and applying to
    internships/research programs. I'm also trying to start a weekly hack night!
    The idea is to have a weekly event where people can come by and code for a while.
    Maybe involve some snacks as well.
  </p>

  <h2> Tutoring </h2>
  <p>
    I'm a private tutor for Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems
    Organization, Operating Systems, and Basic Algorithms. You can schedule a
    session with me by using <a href="https://calendly.com/a1liu/">my Calendly</a>.
    My base rate is $40 per hour for individual tutoring, and $30 per hour per
    person for group tutoring.
