Working with the Java compiler and runtime system can be confusing for new programmers.
Let's talk about it.

## A General Approach to Compilation Errors

## A General Approach to Runtime Errors
Something that works for me is writing down facts. Write down things that you know
about your program, and then check to make sure that each of those things is actually
true. It can be time consuming at first, but it's a good practice, because:

-  Writing things down makes it harder to lose yourself in your code; if you have
   some kind of written record of your thought process, you can backtrack a lot
   easier.
-  It trains you in *critical thinking*, which is arguably the most important skill
   in Computer Science. What you're really doing when you list facts and check them
   is *deductive reasoning*, which is what debugging is all about.
-  As you get better at thinking about how your program is running, you won't need
   to write as much down, and you'll be able to figure out which kinds of things
   to check for first.
