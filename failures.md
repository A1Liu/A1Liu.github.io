title: Failure CV
permalink: /failures/

This is a collection of the failures I've had over the years, including jobs I've
been rejected from, projects I've abandoned, and ideas that just didn't pan out.
The list starts in 2019, and is in reverse chronological order, by application
date; I started this recently, so it's quite a short list, but it'll get longer,
I promise.


### 2019
-  CMU Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering, Summer '20 (rejected)
-  JHU APL Techincal College Internship, Summer '20 (rejected)
-  Google internship, Summer '19 (never responded)
-  Facebook internship, Summer '19 (never responded)
-  Proggo Loggo, a programming language that never saw the light of day
