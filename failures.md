title: Failure CV
permalink: /failures/
---
This is a collection of the failures I've had over the years, including jobs I've
been rejected from, projects I've abandoned, and ideas that just didn't pan out.
The list starts in 2019, and is in reverse chronological order; I started this
recently, so it's quite a short list, but it'll get longer, I promise.

### 2019
-  Google internship for Summer '19
-  Facebook internship for Summer '19
-  Proggo Loggo, a programming language that never saw the light of day
