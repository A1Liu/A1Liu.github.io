Here's my notes for day 2!

## Will Your Code Survive the Attack of the Zombie Pointers?
Zombie pointers are ABA problem pointers.

Hazard pointers don't solve the problem.

Paper - http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2369.pdf

## "Allegro" Means Fast and Happy. Coincidence?
-  Binary search is bad for branch prediction
-  Floyd's algorithm
-  Replace conditional jumps with conditional arithmetic
-  $$(C(n) + M(n) + kD(n))/n$$ where $$C(n)$$ is comparisons, $$M(n)$$ is moves,
   and $$D(n)$$ is distance between subsequent array accesses.
-  Performance improves with specializing to invariants. Should adjust hyper-parameters
   depending on things like type size, type move cost, type comparison cost, etc.
