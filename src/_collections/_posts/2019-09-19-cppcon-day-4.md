## Cpp.chat - Live
-  Jon Kalb, Andrei Alexandrescu, Herb Sutter, Phil Nash
-  Methods for error handling are converging
-  Andrei: "Static-if is the unit of introspection"

## Eliminating Metaprogramming from C++
-  Proposal: constexpr & maybe-constexpr function parameters
   -  Works just like templates
-  There's bugs that are known at compile-time but can't be fixed
-  Concept: No shadow worlds
-  C++ has 4 programming langs
   -  Constexpr
   -  Templates
   -  Macros
-  Proposal for syntax for maybe-constexpr
   -  Switch constexpr on variables to "maybe compile time"
   -  Use consteval for "definitely compile time"
-  Open questions:
   -  How do static function variables work?
   -  What's the runtime type of a a function with compile-time parameters?

## Better Code: Relationships
-  Felt really familiar, almost like Sean has already given this talk at CppNow
   or something.

## Dawn of a New Error
-  `throws` keyword

## Talked to Adi Shavit
