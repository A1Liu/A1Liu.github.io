title: Adding Javascript "Backend"

Javascript is the language that websites use to generate dynamic content. This site currently
doesn't have any (outside of the stuff Bootstrap provides).

## Rationale and Planning
Github doesn't technically have a size limit on repositories, but keeping posts in a single folder
is kinda ridiculous. Not only that, but loading images doesn't scale well at all, and
posting videos is impossible. I'd like to design and build an api to populate my site's pages
with assets.

Building a simple API for interacting with the site will help make it easier to do many
things in the future:

* Embed stuff into the page
* Move files to a database
* Start building video games to play in my website

In addition, I'll also be forced to inspect the website's architecture and
establish an API for the JS, HTML, and CSS to talk to each other; it'll be really annoying,
but it's a good idea to prevent the source code from getting out completely unmanageable.

This post will be written in parallel with a documentation post that describes the API.
