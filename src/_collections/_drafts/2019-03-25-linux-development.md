I've started developing on Linux! Here's a recounting of some of the things I've learned,
in part because sharing information is important, and in part because I might forget
what I did.

*  Learning cross platform stuff, and POSIX commands; adding a config repo
*  Setting up GalliumOS
   *  Zsh
   *  Acer C720
      *  GNOME and terminal, finding answers for questions is hard
      *  Disassembly, legacy mode, etc
*  Second time's the charm: linux on a budget
   *  Acer C710
   *  DDR3 RAM
