I've started developing on Linux! Here's a recounting of some of the things I've learned,
in part because sharing information is important, and in part because I might forget
what I did.

### Initial Plan
I've been meaning to try using Linux for a while now. My plan was to buy a Chromebook,
and install [GalliumOS][gallium-os] on it. From there, I'd start downloading apps
and figure out a plan of attack for customizing it for maximum performance.

### First Steps
I researched a few models of Acer, Dell, and HP computers using [the guide on the
GalliumOS wiki][hardware-guide]

*  Learning cross platform stuff, and POSIX commands; adding a config repo
*  Setting up GalliumOS
   *  Zsh
   *  Acer C720
      *  GNOME and terminal, finding answers for questions is hard
      *  Disassembly, legacy mode, etc
*  Second time's the charm: linux on a budget
   *  Acer C710
   *  DDR3 RAM
