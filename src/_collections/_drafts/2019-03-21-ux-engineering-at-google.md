[App Academy Graduation Event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/app-academy-google-present-ux-engineering-tickets-58159391305):
Meeting google engineers, listening to them talk about being a googler, Q &amp; A at
the end.

### Meeting the Engineers
Seems like you don't need a CS degree to do UX engineering; it's more about things
outside of engineering, and applying them to an engineered medium.

* Johanna - Cloud stuff
* Iris - Jigsaw
* Edwin - Google search
* Aaron - Google docs
* Alex - Recruiter

"UX Engineer" as a role hasn't been around that long (4-5 years)

## UX at Google
*  1998-2011 - Functionality & utiility
   *  If you're at google, you want to go somewhere else
   *  Used ethos to get base for other products
   *  Weird problem where every product looks different
*  2011 - Guidelines & consistency: kennedy project
   *  Make all programs look the same
   *  Design language
*  2014 - Principles & Framework - Material design
   *  Kennedy doesn't work great on mobile
   *  Material design works well cross-platform
   *  Functionality; i.e. where is information located
*  2015 - Versatility & context - Branding
   *  Branding needs to be versatile
   *  You need to know that you're using a google product regardless of what you're using
   *  Tons of different products. How do you make it cohesive?
   *  Case study: google fi; it's an internet service so what do you even do with
      the interface? What do you do when you wait to connect, etc.
   *  UX answers these questions

### The many hats of UXers
*  Interaction Designers
*  UX Researcher - Talk to people, getting ideas and getting feedback on ideas
*  UX Engineer - What we're here to talk about
*  UX Writer - What's the content? How do we communicate to the user?
*  Viz. Designer - Focused on way things look, communicating using visual/colors
   *  Motion designer - very similar
*  UX Manager - PM's for UX, hollistic role

## What is UX Engineering
Design | Developing
:---:  | :---:
*  Visual/interaction designer | Front end SWE Backend SWE

There's a gap there: filled a the gap with
*  UX egineering w/ design
*  UX Egnineering more no engineering

### Design lens
*  UI, motion, UX  
   designers that can code
*  Prototypes + frameworks
*  Partners with resesarchers on product design
*  Usually reports to a UX manager

### SWE Lens
*  Archintecture/frameworks and UX  
   full stack devs. w/ strong front end skills
*  Builds products
*  Usually reports to SWE PM

### UX Traits
*  Solid understanding of programming
*  Strong advocate for UX, adept at UI implementation
*  Great collaborators (design, research, product partners)
*  Glue between designers + engineers

### Testing new features
High fidelity prototyping for concept validation and user testing

**Improving the UX process:** Identify bottlenecks and create tools/plugins to improve workflows
*e.g. they use "sketch"*

**Building components & UI libraries:** Integrating custom-built reusable UI components into an existing system
Designing and building a full UI library of components to build multiple pages

**Present possibilities:** Sometimes we create prototypes to show an idea to stakeholders, users and partners.
Its's a cool way to convince people to put something into production!

**Exploring emerging tech:** Pesearching new tech. and compelling use cases and interaction patterns for them
Wearables, VUI + conversational design, AR, VR, ...

**Experiment!!:** Sometimes we go out of the way to make fun, engaging experiments. Use your creativity!

## Applying to Google
Process:
*  Recruiter screen
*  Phone interview
   *  One of the engineers asks u to code for them in google docs
*  Coding exercise
   *  Exercise question -> implement it as best you can
*  On-site interview
   *  Ask you question about stuff -> 4 interviews
   *  2 design and 2 coding
   *  Usually 4 interviews
*  Hiring comittee
*  Offer

Resume:
*  Succinctly describe your relevant project/work experiences
*  Describe how you used certain languages, programs, and tech. for your project
*  Readability > creativity for your resume, include a link to your portfolio to
   showcase your designwork or research

Portfolio:
*  Communicate - include the problem, process, solution
*  Distinguish - make clear individual project contributions vs. team-based work
*  Show passion - passion/personal projects are encouraged

## Questions

*  Q: are the questions algo or JS based?
*  A: For UX, its JS mostly, browser questions including performance/latency, focus
      on platform. Prep candidates based off of preferred platform, curate panelists
      around platformm

*  Q: As a UXE's what are some of your daily challenges
*  A: Expectations are sometimes high because you're a jack-of-all-trades. Engineers
      ask for super hard coding, designers expect you to know adobe suite n stuff like
      that.

*  Q: Since it's less coding based, what kind of resources do you use to prep for the
      interview?
*  A: I can't recall any specific books/authors, I do have a resource that I share
      that's platform specific w/ more recommendations.

*  Q: How did you guys prep?
*  A: Yeah so we were sent a list w/ resource recommendations. For web, make sure you know
      what exists in CSS and JS, that there's no corners of the language that you haven't
      explored. Make sure you're exposed to the breadth of the languages.

*  Q: Are the documents that you mentioned available online?
*  A: Alex: No, but they're not secret or anything. Just reach out on linkedIn

*  Q: We're mostly bootcamp grads, what do you have to say about design stuff?
*  A: Johanna: So that's actually me, I came from a bootcamp. Yeah you don't need that much of a background
      like I didn't it was fine

*  Q: How do you define success?
*  A: Aaron: Recent movement to go beyond LOCs or features, bc that's focusing on launch as
      measure of success, but nobody cares that rocket launched, they care about landing.
      So right now we're focusing on impact instead of shipping quickly. Like sometimes
      we consider saving time as success.

*  Q: What's the matching process for being on a specific team?
*  A: Johanna: The junior positions don't really care, but the senior positions care quite about
      the background you have.
      Aaron: More about skills and interests.
      Alex: We don't do matching until *after* you're accepted
      Edwin: Some are specific, like data viz., or that kind of thing
      Alex: Yeah but that's inda niche, 90% we don't know

*  Q: What exactly do you look for in the "finding the fit" process?
*  A: Alex: there's so many scenarios, basically everyone who qualifies can find a fit
      somewhere, and hiring managers are usually cool w/ who we give them bc people
      who come are super talented.
      Edwin: The candidate is usually more selective; location
      sensitive, or not interested in the project.
      Alex: Yeah NY is a lot more sparse

*  Q: 
*  A: Alex: We have recruiting teams for each thing (SWE, UX, etc.), the general recruiters
      send you over to other teams for your specific type. Sometimes if you don't know,
      you'll be working w/ 2 different recruiters at the same time.
      Edwin: Recruiters sometimes send you to other recruiters because you're a better
      fit for someone else.

*  Q: 
*  A: UXC has two lenses, SWE is something completely different. Sometimes people
      ask for front-end but they don't realize that UX works

*  Q: UX Engineer is kinda unique to Google, what would be the best way to go about
      channeling your application through the beaurocracy pipeline?
*  A: Alex: Google is very data-driven. Google never throws away resumes.
      we have sourcers that look at passive candidates -> they send to channels groups,
      trained and dedicated to reviewing to resumes -> then sent to Alex.
      Really not much you can do besides send your resume.

*  Q: And trust that Google will get it right?
*  A: Yeah you can apply to multiple things, and Google will pair you with the right one usually.

*  Q: What would you expect to see on a student's resume in UX?
*  A: Alex: We don't expect new grads to have tons of experience, you just let school
      and youre focused on that. Have demonstrated interests/passions. SHowing that you're engaged
      and curious.
      Iris: Yeah portfolios are useful if you don't have exact experience, to show
      your passion

*  Q: Along those lines, how documented were your projects?
*  A: Iris: Better to have a link, show the code, the project itself, what's your process,
      the more process the better
      Edwin: Link to your Github, we look at how you code, your style

*  Q: Is having a really good README useful? Should I document in the code or the README?
*  A: Comments are dumb don't do it unless its useful.
      Aaron: I'm reviewing a lot of code right now, and you should make it obvious where
      the interesting stuff is

*  Q: You said recent grads shouldn't have that much experience, does that also count
      for bootcamp grads?
*  A: Alex: we definitely don't pass judgement for not having prior experience, just
      meet the technical bar. More about your own merit, and your own abilities.
      Aaron: in UX, there's different bars for the different roles, teams look for
      different bars for the different roles.
      Edwin: we also have internships lol, anybody can apply to those

*  Q: What excites you about your current work?
*  A: Johanna: I'm now working on something that a ton of people use!
      Iris: My team is just exciting. We work in a political space, help people at risk,
      so we go to Ukraine, Middle East, etc. 

*  Q: How does one end up at google UX as a contractor?
*  A: Johanna: Oh, so that was a recruiter at a bootcamp that there was an open position.
      I submitted my resume and I got in.

*  Q: Was that through Google's recruiting?
*  A: No that was a completely different agency. Nelson staffing, cornerstone both
      work with Google.

*  Q: If an applicant got rejected in the interview process, what are the chances of getting reinterviewed?
*  A: Alex: It can really vary. Lets assume you got rejected by the hiring committee,
      what we say for that is around a year of waiting, because that's enough for you to grow in your career.

*  Q: When you see a problem and you have a solution, how do you present that?
*  A: Aaron: yeah so google has lots of opportunities for people to present solutions
      that they figured out. One we have that's well known is the 20% time one. We
      also have "Area 120" which is a startup incubator for employees to work on projects
      full time if they're accepted.

*  Q: How many years do you need before you can do stuff with Area 120 or 20% time?
*  A: Aaron: Area 120 is around 6 months to a year formally. 20% time is just something
      you figure out w/ your manager once you're comfortable with your role.
