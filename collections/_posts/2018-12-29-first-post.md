I don't think this blog will be very personal, at least to start.
The aim of this blog right now is simply to document the kind of work I'm doing in my life.
Most, if not all, of the posts will be descriptions of pull requests or personal projects that I'm working on.
Half will probably be related to the formatting of this website, describing my process and what I learned in the process.

Eventually, as I get older this medium might evolve into an actual _blog._ Until then, this will essentially
 be a collection of CS-related updates (that I'll probably copy-paste from when writing pull request descriptions).
