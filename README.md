# Homepage
This is the repository for my homepage.

### Rationale
I'm using this project as an opportunity to learn web development, and also test out some HTML and CSS things in a sandbox environment. In the past this project was written with REACT. I'm going to switch over to Jekyll for now, and introduce REACT into the page as I become more comfortable with web development.

### Blogging and Alternatives to Social Media
I don't really like social media, but I'd love to throw my thoughts out into the void.
This site will hold things that I think, as well as things that I'm working on.
Hopefully it acts as a social media that more accurately reflects the kinds of things I'm interested in.
