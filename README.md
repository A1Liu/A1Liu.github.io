# Homepage
This is the repository for my homepage.

## Rationale
I'm using this project as an opportunity to learn web development, and also test out some HTML and CSS things in a sandbox environment. In the past this project was written with REACT. I'm going to switch over to Jekyll for now, and introduce REACT into the page as I become more comfortable with web development.

### Blogging and Alternatives to Social Media
I don't really like social media, but I'd love to throw my thoughts out into the void.
This site will hold things that I think, as well as things that I'm working on.
Hopefully it acts as a social media that more accurately reflects the kinds of things I'm interested in.

### Self-Promotion
I'd like to get a job, and this could help (I hope?)

## Using the Build REPL
The only dependency is PyYAML, which can be installed using `pip install yaml`.

The collection we're editing is stored in `col`; to change this, use
`col= <collection name>`. To get help, do `help <command>`.
